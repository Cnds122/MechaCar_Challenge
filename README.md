- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.

The results dictate that the variance when all lots are grouped together is 62 PSI, which meet the specifications required.
When looking at lots individually, lot 1 and lot 2 also meet the requirements with 1 and 7 PSI, respectively. Lot 3 has a variance of 170 PSI which does not meet design specifications.

# Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
- What metric or metrics are you going to test?
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
- What data is needed to run the statistical test?
